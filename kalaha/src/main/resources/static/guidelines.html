        <ul>
            <li>We will primarily check correctness (game logic), clean code, design simplicity and consistency</li>
            <li>Please use one programming paradigm (object oriented, functional etc) consistently</li>
            <li>Follow TDD and provide enough code coverage with tests</li>
            <li>Pay attention to data structure choices</li>
            <li>Make a choice about in-memory/sql/nosql persistence and explain why you chose one over another</li>
            <li>There are more than one way to establish communication between players and the server. Please explain your choice</li>
            <li>Consider inherent challenges that have to be solved while implementing frontend and backend (e.g. communication protocol, concurrency, scalability)
                but try to provide simple and elegant solutions rather than throwing tools and frameworks into the implementation.
                If time is short, prefer to summarize the outlines of certain details rather than implementing it.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, Try to come at least with a minimal document where you express your flow of thinking (so we can see how you think and express your thoughts)
