<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
    First of all congratulations! You have made it to the second round. In this round,
    we would like to assess your technical skills.</p>
<p>
    We ask you to build a simple game called Kalaha. We are providing you a
    skeleton project where some of the components have been chosen for you.
    Actually in bol.com, as developers we have freedom (up to some level) to
    choose tech stacks ourselves. However, for this technical assignment, to be
    able to give you more time on coding, we decided to provide you some directions.
</p>
<p>
    Please take a look at instructions, game rules and guidelines before you start with coding.
