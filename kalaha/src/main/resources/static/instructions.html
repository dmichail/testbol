<p>
    At bol.com, the majority of our code is written in Java. Therefore, we prefer that you implement this assignment in
    Java. However if you have a good reason to implement it in another programming language (still preferably a JVM
    language), do not hesitate to discuss it with us.
</p>
<p>
    We would like you to implement Kalaha game as a web application together with a REST backend
    The rules of the game are explained in <a href="game-rules.html">"Game Rules"</a>. Here you could read about our requirements
    regarding the backend service.
</p>
<p>
    This web application should be implemented in a way that multiple players can play the game in pairs (2 players per
    game). Therefore you have to roll some kind of communication between two clients (via the service endpoint).
</p>
<p>
    We provided you spring boot based project with skeleton code which contains empty classes, some static assets and
    a simple UI to start with. Feel free to add necessary stuff (and preferably avoid removing) as long as you adhere to
    endpoint specification (we will be using it for automated tests to check correctness in the future)
</p>
<p>
    You could reach game's user interface via <a href="http://localhost:8080/game">localhost:8080/game</a>
</p>
<h3>Required Endpoints</h3>

}

Response :
{
       "playerId" : 1
}
  </code>
</pre>

}
  </code>
</pre>

<h4>Requesting Game for the Player</h4>

Request :
GET /game/{playerId}

Response :

Otherwise (200) return a "Game" response following the schema :

{
  "Game" : {
    "id" : 1,
          [
            "Player" : {
                "id" : 1,
              "name" : "Carl Sagan",
            "kalaha" : 0,
              "pits" : [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
              },
            "Player" : {
                "id" : 2,
              "name" : "Richard Feynman",
            "kalaha" : 0,
              "pits" : [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
            }],
    "turnOfWithId" : 1,
          "isOver" : false,
          "winner" : null
