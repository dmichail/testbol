</div>
<h4>Board Setup</h4>
<p>There are two players per game. Each player has six pits and one larger pit called Kalaha in front of her.
    Initially there are six stones in each pit (and none in Kalaha).</p>
<h4>Game Play</h4>
<p>The player who begins with the first move picks up all the stones from one
    of own six pits, and sows (distribute) the stones one by one into the pits
    in the counter clock direction, including his own Kalaha and opponents pits. No stones
    are put in the opponent's Kalaha. If the player's last stone lands in her own Kalaha,
    she gets another turn. This can be repeated several times before it's opponent's turn.</p>
<h4>Capturing Stones</h4>
<p>During the game the pits are emptied on both sides. Always when the last
    stone lands in an own empty pit, the player captures his/her own stone and
    all stones in the opposite pit (the other players' pit) and puts them in her own Kalaha.</p>
<h4>Victory Condition</h4>
<p>The game is over as soon as one of the sides run out of stones. The player
    who still has stones in his pits keeps them and puts them in her Kalaha.
    Winner of the game is the player who has the most stones in her Kalaha.</p>
